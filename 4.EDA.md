**🧼 Dirty Cafe Sales – SQL Data Cleaning & Analysis Project**
This project focuses on cleaning and analysing transactional sales data from a café. After removing or accounting for null values, I used SQL to answer key business questions and applied window functions, aggregates, and CTEs to uncover trends and performance insights.

**🔧 Cleaning & Preparation**
Null values were found in key columns like location, payment_method, and transaction_date. These rows were retained but excluded from specific analyses as we had no way to accurately impute them.

**📌 Key Business Questions & SQL Analysis**

**❓1. What are the top-selling items by quantity?**

💡Insights:
- Cake is the most sold item (Although each item has sold over 3000 times). This can help the cafe with inventory planning or on how to increase the sales of lower-selling items.

**❓2. Which items generated the most revenue?**

💡Insights:
- Although cake is the most sold item, we can see that salad has the highest revenue for the year.

**❓3. Which months generated the most revenue?**

💡Insights:
- Revenue per month seems pretty even across each month, with the difference between the top-selling month, June, and the lowest-selling month, February, being $623.
- Could potentially do some sales or promotional trends during the lower months of Feb, May & September.

**❓4. Which months fall in the top 25% of total revenue?**

💡Insights:
- June, October, and April are the top 25% revenue months
- A great period for marketing pushes or seasonal campaigns.

**❓5. Revenue by location (In-store vs Takeaway)**

💡Insights:
- In-store revenue (24,598) slightly exceeds Takeaway (23,868)
- However, a large chunk of transactions (~32k) had NULL location, which limits the completeness of this analysis.

**❓6. Cumulative revenue per item over time**

💡Insights:
- Allows you to track when each item reaches revenue milestones.
- Useful for identifying slow vs. fast-moving products

**❓7. Monthly and cumulative revenue trend**

💡Insights:
- Revenue grows steadily month-over-month
- Useful for forecasting and visualising long-term sales growth.

**❓8. When did each item first exceed 2,000 in revenue?**

💡Insights:
- Salad & Sandwich reach this milestone the quickest
- Cookies only crossed it in August — indicates slower performance.

**❓9. Which day of the week brings in the most revenue?**

💡Insights:
- Expect weekends to be top of the revenue list, but surprisingly, Monday tops the revenue chart; this could be due to the NULL values not taken into account
